# Adblocker blocker blocker

![Logo](https://github.com/dkleiman/adblockerblockerblocker/raw/master/icon128.png)

Small browser extension to block simple sites that block adblocker.

Just click on the icon to run a script that reloads the page with none of their javascript.

So far it works on:
-<http://wwww.wired.com>

Sites that are too complicated for it (it just kills the page):
-<http://forbes.com>
